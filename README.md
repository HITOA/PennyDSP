# PennyDSP
Penny Digital Signal Processing JUCE module  
  
To use the module, you simply have to clone the repos in your usermodule (JUCE) directory. the name of the repos folder must be PennyDSP.

This is (for now at least) simply the juce_dsp module remade from scratch for learning purpose. so it is heavily based on how the juce_dsp module work.
