# Penny Deep Reverb

Really simple reverb plugin with Feedback and Size parameters. (+ Dry wet mix of course)

My first audio plugin. it's not good, but i am learning and still pretty happy with the result. it's messy tho, there is a lot of weird things going on in the code but meh.
I tried to redo from scratch everything, so even if i could use the juce_dsp module to do the plugin, i prefer not to, cz i'm learning.

One source that helped me a lot for developing this plugin : https://valhalladsp.com/2009/05/30/schroeder-reverbs-the-forgotten-algorithm/
